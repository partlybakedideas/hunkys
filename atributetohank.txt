Hank the pigeon was the original founder of Hunky’s. At first he struggled with business, but Hank persisted. It was hard, but Hank never gave up. Then, on September 26th, 2017, the first purchase was made. (It has been the only one ever since ownership changed) Hank was proud of his creation. His courage, pride, determination and ability to manipulate people paid off. Unfortunately, good things don’t last forever, and before Hank got a chance to create a website using wix, he passed on. While on his deathbed, he whispered into his friend Frank the bear’s ear, “When I’m gone, find someone with enough courage to take over my underground company.” And that’s what he did. KitKat took ownership of the company, and managed to hire three full time employees. Now we thank Hank the beloved pigeon for creating the not very renowned company. Now, he watches on in heaven as the new team members come up with innovative ideas. Here at Hunky’s we all hope Hank ended up in a better place. Wherever he is, I know he’s looking down on us with a mix of pride, sadness and joy of the products we make. 

Thank you Hank,

WildBoar, employee of Hunky’s
